# UI/UX Audit Report - Nadlaner

**Date:** January 2025  
**Auditor:** Senior Product/UX Engineer  
**Scope:** Key user flows and design system consistency

## Executive Summary

Nadlaner is a real estate intelligence platform with a solid foundation but requires focused improvements in design consistency, RTL implementation, and user experience polish. The current implementation shows good architectural decisions with Radix UI and Tailwind, but lacks systematic design tokens and has several UX friction points.

## Key Findings

### ✅ Strengths
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Next.js 14, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS with RTL support
- **Comprehensive Data Model**: Rich asset data structure with proper typing
- **RTL Foundation**: Basic RTL support with `dir="rtl"` and tailwindcss-rtl
- **Component Architecture**: Well-structured component hierarchy
- **Data Consistency**: Single Asset type used across list and details

### ⚠️ Critical Issues (P0)
1. **Design Token Inconsistency**: Mixed color systems and spacing values
2. **RTL Implementation Gaps**: Inconsistent icon mirroring and spacing
3. **Mock Data Usage**: Alerts page uses mock data instead of real API
4. **Accessibility Gaps**: Missing ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
5. **Mobile UX Issues**: Table horizontal scrolling problems

### 🔧 High Priority (P1)
1. **Loading States**: Inconsistent skeleton/loading patterns
2. **Error Handling**: Basic error states without recovery actions
3. **Form Validation**: Inline validation missing in several forms
4. **Navigation State**: Active states not properly managed
5. **Performance**: Potential re-render issues in large tables
