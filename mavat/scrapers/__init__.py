"""Scrapers for the Mavat domain.

This subpackage contains scraping logic for interacting with the
`mavat.iplan.gov.il` site.  Currently it exposes the
``MavatScraper`` class which uses Playwright to automate the
site and extract search results and plan details.  It is designed
to be minimal and selfâ€‘contained so it can be reused in CLI tools,
FastAPI microservices or data pipelines.
